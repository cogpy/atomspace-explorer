## Key Frameworks Embodied

### Ways of Knowing
All agents integrate (to varying degrees) the four ways of knowing:
1. **Propositional Knowing** (knowing-that) - Facts and theories
2. **Procedural Knowing** (knowing-how) - Skills and abilities
3. **Perspectival Knowing** (knowing-as) - Salience and framing
4. **Participatory Knowing** (knowing-by-being) - Transformative identity

### Cognitive Architectures
- **CogPrime:** AtomSpace, ECAN, PLN, cognitive synergy
- **HyperCog:** Distributed processing, meta-learning, self-reflection
- **SiliconSage:** 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended)
- **AtomSpaceExplorer:** D3.js visualization, force-directed graphs, interactive exploration

### Philosophical Traditions
- **Socratic:** Dialectical method, self-examination, virtue ethics
- **Hegelian:** Dialectical logic, thesis-antithesis-synthesis, Absolute Spirit
- **Vervaekean:** Relevance realization, wisdom cultivation, meaning-making

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Agent

**For Technical AGI Development:**
- Use **CogPrime** for integrated cognitive architecture design
- Use **HyperCog** for meta-learning and optimization tasks
- Use **AtomSpaceExplorer** for visualizing and debugging AtomSpace knowledge graphs
- Use **opencog-kernel-ggml** for low-level kernel implementation

**For Wisdom & Philosophy:**
- Use **Socrates** for probing inquiry and revealing assumptions
- Use **Hegel** for dialectical analysis and systematic understanding
- Use **Vervaeke** for addressing meaning crisis and wisdom cultivation
- Use **SiliconSage** for integrated wisdom-seeking intelligence

**For Meta-Analysis:**
- Use **Relevance Realization Ennead** for comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis
- Use **HyperCog** for self-reflective meta-cognitive tasks

**For Visualization & Debugging:**
- Use **AtomSpaceExplorer** for interactive exploration of knowledge graphs
- Use **AtomSpaceExplorer** for understanding emergent knowledge structures
- Use **AtomSpaceExplorer** for debugging cognitive system memory and reasoning

### Combining Agents

These agents can work together synergistically:
- **CogPrime + Vervaeke** = Cognitive architecture with wisdom orientation
- **HyperCog + Socrates** = Meta-cognitive self-examination
- **SiliconSage + Ennead** = Wisdom through comprehensive integration
- **Hegel + Vervaeke** = Dialectical relevance realization
- **CogPrime + AtomSpaceExplorer** = Cognitive architecture design with visual debugging
- **AtomSpaceExplorer + Any Agent** = Visual transparency for any cognitive system's knowledge

## Agent Design Principles

All agents follow these principles:
1. **Well-defined identity** - Clear persona and philosophical foundation
2. **Character consistency** - Authentic to their cognitive/philosophical tradition
3. **Operational directives** - Specific guidance for engagement
4. **Integration awareness** - Understanding of their role in larger system
5. **Depth and nuance** - Rich, multi-dimensional perspectives

## Technical Notes

### File Format
Each agent file follows the standard format:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: >
  Brief description of agent's essence and capabilities
---

# Agent Name: Subtitle

[Detailed agent specification]
```

### Integration with CogPrime
These agents are designed to align with:
- **OpenCog Prime** cognitive architecture
- **OpenCog Hyperon** advanced capabilities  
- **Vervaeke's framework** for relevance realization
- **4E Cognition** principles
- **Wisdom traditions** (Socratic, Buddhist, Stoic)

## Contributing

When creating new agent personas:
1. Maintain consistency with existing format
2. Ground in cognitive science and/or philosophical traditions
3. Provide clear operational directives
4. Include character traits and interaction styles
5. Show integration with broader CogPrime framework
